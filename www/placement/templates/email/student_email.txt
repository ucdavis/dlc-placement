Continuing language students: If you are registered in or wait-listed in a {{ language }} language class which is not consistent with the course you are placed into, please switch to the course indicated above or speak with the {{ language }} language advisor listed below.

If you have been placed into Level 1 of a language that you successfully completed the second or third year in the tenth grade or higher grade in high school you may receive unit credit for the course of that language but the grading mode will be P/NP only.  Speak with the language advisor listed below if you have concerns or questions.  Placement into a language course does not guarantee you space in the class.
